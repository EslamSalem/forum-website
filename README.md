# The Book Club ðŸ“–
This is a simple forum website made by me and two other colleagues in our freshman year of CS as part of a web development summer training.
# Introduction
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop this site. We primarily did Front-end, but we used session storage and local storage to save some data to present it to the user later.
# Screenshots and Demo
The first page you encounter is the registeration page. Fill out the fields to create your account. The account is then saved in local storage in case we need to validate if the user is registered if he wants to log in again.

After registering or logging in, you are then taken to the "Home" page where you can post in the thread of your liking. You can also learn more about us in the "About" page or view your profile.
